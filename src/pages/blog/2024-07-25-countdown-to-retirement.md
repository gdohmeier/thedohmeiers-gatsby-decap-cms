As the date for my retirement approached, I thought it would be fun to create a count down timer to the last day.  I have made a few iterations to during development and ended up with [this version](https://garydohmeier.com/countdown-to-retirement/) on my old website.

The code for the countdown clock versions is in gitlab [here.](https://gitlab.com/gdohmeier/countdown/-/blob/master/countdown3.html?ref_type=heads)

As of Sept 2024 I have updated this code (see below) to include a date picker so its more generic and you can set the date to countdown too.

<div style="height: 100vh; position: relative;">
  <iframe src="https://gad-games.netlify.app/game3/" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;"></iframe>
</div>
